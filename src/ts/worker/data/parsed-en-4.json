This happens on structure c, which defines what various values and limits mean. b is the 'order' of the result of this convergence (so that it is the bth-order integral (equivalently, -bth-order derivative) of the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a so that b = -1 yields the Dirac delta 'function' centered/with interesting point at 0, b = 0 yields the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a centered at/with interesting point 0, etc.).  Natural numbers (or 0) for b yield a 'special' polynomial (let us call it p) of that order in indeterminant a for all values of a greater than 0 and 0 for all values of a less than 0 so that p(a) = a^b Theta(a). Input e is for when the particular functions in d are of interest and only e of them have been computed (so that, for finite e, the output is not exactly the bth order Heaviside function); in other words, the limit of the family indices is being taken to e; this is of particular importance for negative values of b: |b| > 1, since they will not be identically 0 in some sense (else, all information is lost about the special structure/nature of this function). The contextless defaults are: b = 0, c is the field of real numbers (with absolute value norm and ordering due to signed absolute value), d is bth-order integral of ((1 + y + z * erf(k a / (2^(1/2)) ) ) / 2)-like functions that are properly normalized and are of proper height, e is infinity (countable). Heaviside(0,0,...,f_0) = 1/2 = f_0 is typical and is a contextless default for b = 0 (however, it may in particular be set to 0 or 1 so that the function is left-/right-continuous at a = 0; for values of b other than 0, f_b = 0 is the contextless default; note that f_(-1) must be infinity 'of the proper magnitude' (it cannot be specified to be otherwise).

So, if $x_1$ is a set or a complicated sumti string composed via connectives, then $x_5 = 1$ constructs a singleton set containing $x_1$ and then the referent drawn is, necessarily, $x_1$; meanwhile, if $x_5 = 2$, then some member of $x_4$ itself, excluding $x_1$ (whatsoever it may be), is the referent which is drawn; for the purposes of $x_5$, $x_1$ and $x_4$ are treated asymmetrically, for the sake of utility and minimal complication.

This word can be used to specify the concept of \"$n$th cousin $m$-times removed\"-ness; $x_1$ and $x_2$ would be the cousins, $x_3-1 = n$, and $x_4$ is closely related to $m$ but is signed. If one views the tree graphs to which $x_1$ and $x_2$ belong with the viewing perspective such that siblings and spouses are mutually separated horizontally and such that ancestors are separated from their descendants vertically (with ancestors in the positive direction relative to their descendants), then $x_3$ is the unsigned horizontal distance between $x_1$ and $x_2$. Additionally, $x_4$ is, approximately, the signed generational offset/difference between subjects $x_1$ and $x_2$; it is their signed 'vertical' difference under the aforementioned viewing perspective and sign convention. The relationship need not actually be cousinhood  (as perceived by English); direct ancestor-descendant pairs, (aunt/uncle)-(niece/nephew) pairs, and in fact any pair of family members with a well-specified most recent common ancestor (that is known) have this relationship to one another. This word can be used for specifying the number of \"great\"'s in the title of a relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$ (with some calculational forethought). The tree diagram can be more generic than a family tree though; thus cousinhood is just a way to put it into context/application and is not really essential to the meaning except through analogy. Notice the ordering of all terms; if the graph is directed, the arguments of the distance matters. The graph should probably be a tree locally if it is to be a well-defined relationship. $x_3$ is unchanged but $x_4$ is negated (multiplied by $-1$) by/under exchange of $x_1$ and $x_2$. The ordered pair $(x_3, x_4)$ is named \"consanguistance between $x_1$ and $x_2$ (in that order)\" by Curtis Franks. For a normal family tree and fixed $x_1$ therein, consanguistance produces countably many equivalence classes of nodes. It does not recognize the difference between half or full relatives, marriages/parentings are either unsupported (when $x_3 > 0$) or are reduced to be equivalent (when $x_3 = 0$ and $x_4 \\neq 0$), and gender/sex are ignored/reduced to equivalence. The set of nodes $x_2$ with $x_3 = 0$ is called $x_1$'s (the subject's) genealogical line (id est: if $x_3 = 0$, then $x_1$ re'au'e ja se dzena $x_2$ according to the edge relation on the graph or $x_1 = x_2$); the set of nodes with $x_3 > 0$ are sibling/branch/side lines, which could be labelled and ordered, but doing so would be somewhat difficult with this word. This word focuses on the relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$, not the relationship between each of them and A; for that, see \".{anseingu}\". The underlying tree graph is, modulo an equivalence relation involving tseingu, a 'quipyew' tree graph (see \"{grafnkipliiu}\"). This concept is fairly unnatural and convoluted, so it is probably {malgli} except for the purpose of translations; in a natural, culturally-neutral Lojbanic context, \".anseingu\" is preferred.","t":"fu'ivla","g":["consanguinity values","consanguistance","cousin degree","cousin order","cousin removal","degree of removal","kinship number"],"r":["tseingu"]},{"w":"tsekane","d":"$x_1$ (linear manifold, vector, etc.) is/lies secant to $x_2$ (object, surface, curve, manifold, etc.) passing through or toward points/loci $x_3$ (set of intersected points), by standard/definition/in system $x_4$.","n":"No necessary implication of co-directionality.

The entry for this cmavo compound is essentially a proposal to redefine the {va'i} spectrum slightly, to make it a little more like the similar discursive {ta'u}. Consider the English sentences: (A) \"Gold has atomic number 79, in other words, there are 79 protons in a gold nucleus.\" (B) \"There are 79 protons in a gold nucleus, in other words, gold has atomic number 79.\" In English, in both A and B, the parts are discursively connected by the same \"in other words\" connective, even though the connection is in two mutually opposite directions. To understand that there really is a difference between the two, consider another pair of sentences: (A') \"According to the Bible, God made the world in six days, in other words, it took almost a week to make everything around us.\" (B') \"According to the Bible, it took almost a week to make everything around us, in other words, God made the world in six days.\" Unlike A and B, from among the pair A' and B', only A' makes sense, B' sounds absurd. The proposal is to redefine Lojban's {va'i} and {va'i} {nai}, in the motivation to give {va'i} {nai} more of a use, to reflect this very Lojbanic difference in direction, which English cannot capture. This compound, i.e. \"va'i cu'i\" would then acquire the meaning of \"in the same words\". There is no set in stone rule for which of {va'i} and {va'i} {nai} stands for which direction for any given two pair of sentences: however, if one of them is used to connect them in one way, then the other one would connect them in the reverse order. \"broda .i va'i nai brode\" simply is defined as equivalent to \"brode .i va'i broda\".

In different bases, this value may change; for example, in hexadecimal, it might be exactly four ($4$); however, this is an outstanding as-of-yet unsolidified area in the Lojban grammar/semantics (do \"{ki'o}\" and Metric prefixes change according to the base?). This number is nice, as it is close to both 3 and and the circle constant pi ($\\pi$) in decimal usage; these three values arise fairly frequently and a great trick in decimal Fermi estimation is to use their approximate identity in order to simplify expressions. Now, when the quantity is dimensionful (has units), if the mantissa approximates this value, then one can instead express the mantissa as approximately 1 and the unit as being augmented by this prefix. This word is also good for short-hand/quick expressions. This word has no English equivalent and is not part of the official set of SI prefixes, but it does generalize them. \"{xaudbo}\" = \"{kamre} {li} {dau} {te'a} {fi'u} {re}\" in decimal (if it generalizes for other bases, change \"dau\" into the base; in other words, \"dau\" generally becomes \"pano\" in such case, where the base is given by context). While this suggestion is not perfectly compatible with SI (which allows only one prefix at a time), the negative-power version of this (\"kamre li dau te'a {ni'u} fi'u re\", where \"dau\" has the aforementioned caveats; $1*10^{-(1/2)}$) can just be expressed as a lujvo/rafsi/tanru containing both \"{decti}\" and this word (as veljvo/selrafsi/{seljavytertau}), because $A^{(-1/2)} = \\sqrt{(1/A)} = A^{(+1/2)} / A$, and $A$ (ten in at least decimal) is the base.

This word uses the proposed/experimental rafsi '-ve'i-' of the experimental gismu \"{vedli}\"; it also relies on \"slabu\" taking a greater connotation of familiarity/'knowledge' (in the Spanish \"conocer\" sense) due to the introduction of the experimental gismu \"{laldo}\" for other meanings of \"old\".","t":"lujvo","g":["familiar to the memory","has lived memory of and familiarity with"],"r":["ve'i"],"v":["vedli","slabu"]},{"w":"veirtermi'u","d":"$m_1$ is a URI identifying resource $m_2$=$v_1$, which is a record of $v_2$ about $v_3$ preserved in medium $v_4$","t":"lujvo","g":["URI"],"v":["vreji","te","mintu"]},{"w":"veisle","d":"$x_1$ is a record cell or field containing data $x_2$, part of record $x_3$","n":"See also {datnyvau}","t":"lujvo","g":["field","record cell"],"v":["vreji","selci"]},{"w":"veisri","d":"$x_1$=$d_1$=$v_4$ is a signal recording and playback tape-type medium (cassette/DAT/tape drive) containing data/sound/image $x_2$=$v_2$ with data storage mechanism/method x3 (analog/digital)","n":"Cf. {datnysri}, {srimakyvelvei}.","t":"lujvo","g":["cassette tape"],"v":["vreji","dasri"]},{"w":"velbajra","d":"$x_4$=$b_1$ runs on surface $x_2$=$b_2$ using limbs $x_3$=$b_3$ with gait $x_1$=$b_4$.","n":"{ve} {bajra}","t":"lujvo","g":["running gait"],"v":["ve","bajra"]},{"w":"velbancu","d":"$x_4$=$b_1$ exceeds/is beyond limit/boundary $x_2$=$b_2$ from $x_3$=$b_3$ in property/amount $x_1$=$b_4$ (ka/ni).","n":"{ve} {bancu}","t":"lujvo","g":["beyondness property"],"v":["ve","bancu"]},{"w":"velbatci","d":"$x_4$=$b_1$ bites/pinches $x_2$=$b_2$ on/at specific locus $x_3$=$b_3$ with $x_1$=$b_4$.","n":"{ve} {batci}","t":"lujvo","g":["biting tool"],"v":["ve","batci"]},{"w":"velbatke","d":"$x_4$=$b_1$ is a button/knob/handle on/for item $x_2$=$b_2$, with purpose $x_3$=$b_3$, made of material $x_1$=$b_4$.","n":"{ve} {batke}","t":"lujvo","g":["button material"],"v":["ve","batke"]},{"w":"velbe'e","d":"$x_4$=$b_1$ is a crew/team/gang/squad/band of persons $x_2$=$b_2$ directed/led by $x_3$=$b_3$ organized for purpose $x_1$=$b_4$.","n":"{ve} {bende}","t":"lujvo","g":["crew purpose"],"v":["ve","bende"]},{"w":"velbei","d":"$x_4$=$b_1$ carries/hauls/bears/transports cargo $x_2$=$b_2$ to $x_3$=$b_3$ from $x_1$=$b_4$ over path $x_5$=$b_5$; $x_4$=$b_1$ is a carrier/porter.","n":"{ve} {bevri}","t":"lujvo","g":["cargo origin"],"v":["ve","bevri"]},{"w":"velbinra","d":"$x_4$=$b_1$ insures/indemnifies $x_2$=$b_2$ against peril $x_3$=$b_3$ providing benefit $x_1$=$b_4$.","n":"{ve} {binra}","t":"lujvo","g":["insured benefit"],"v":["ve","binra"]},{"w":"velbi'u","d":"$x_4$=$b_1$ is a wall/fence separating $x_2$=$b_2$ from $x_3$=$b_3$, and subdividing $x_1$=$b_4$.","n":"{ve} {bitmu}","t":"lujvo","g":["subdivided"],"v":["ve","bitmu"]},{"w":"velbo'a","d":"$x_4$=$b_1$ is a wave/periodic pattern in medium $x_2$=$b_2$, with wave-form $x_3$=$b_3$, wave-length $x_1$=$b_4$ and frequency $x_5$=$b_5$.","n":"{ve} {boxna}","t":"lujvo","g":["wave-length"],"v":["ve","boxna"]},{"w":"velcange","d":"$x_4$=$c_1$ is a farm/ranch at $x_2$=$c_2$, of rancher $x_3$=$c_3$ raising/producing $x_1$=$c_4$.","n":"{ve} {cange}, see also {banro}","t":"lujvo","g":["farm produce"],"v":["ve","cange"]},{"w":"velcanja","d":"$x_4$=$c_1$ exchanges/trades/barters commodity $x_2$=$c_2$ for $x_3$=$c_3$ with $x_1$=$c_4$.","n":"{ve} {canja}","t":"lujvo","g":["exchanged with"],"v":["ve","canja"]},{"w":"velcki","d":"$x_{1}$ is an explanation of $x_{2}$ (event/state/property) to $x_{3}$ by $x_{4}$.","n":"Cf. {ciksi}.","t":"lujvo","g":["definition","explanation"],"v":["ve","ciksi"]},{"w":"velcli","d":"$x_1$ is a learning source for learning $x_2$ (du'u) about subject $x_3$ for learner $x_4$ by method $x_5$","t":"lujvo","g":["source"],"v":["ve","cilre"]},{"w":"velcradyjunla","d":"$j_1$=$c_4$ is a radio clock receiving the time from broadcaster/radio transmitter $c_1$.","t":"lujvo","g":["radio clock"],"v":["ve","cradi","junla"]},{"w":"veldilcu","d":"$x_1$ is the division-remainder of \"$x_2$/$x_3$\" with quotient $x_4$ // $x_1$ = $x_2$ modulo $x_3$","n":"\"$x_1$ == $x_2$ % $x_3$\" in many programming languages.","t":"lujvo","g":["division remainder","modulo","remainder"],"v":["ve","dilcu"]},{"w":"velfi'i","d":"$x_1$ is the inspiration for creating $x_2$ for purpose $x_3$ by creator $x_4$","n":"= {ve} {finti}.

If a language lacks a minimal pair which distinguishes paired phon√©s, then any strings which nominally differ in only such pairs will belong to $x_2$ of this word in that language; in other words allophonic but not phonemic differences produce such similarities. But even with minimal pairs, some words may not be distinguishable. This word refers to indistinguishability in the form of a word as well as its meaning/usage; so, homophones are not necessarily similar in this sense, nor are synonyms. The combination of both qualities does produce such similarities in spoken English (not necessarily written English, since the orthography is not phonemic). In English, phonation duration and, in some cases, certain phonation qualities (such as tonation, voicing, nasalation, place of articulation, aspiration, etc. (again: only in some cases)) do not distinguish words. Dialectal differences usually produce such similarities too (a U.S. English speaker and a UK English speaker will say the word \"car\" differently but will agree about everything concerning it, including its rhyming qualities in their dialects, its meaning, and its spelling). In Lojban, phonation duration (such as \".{yyy} \" versus merely \".{y} \"; but notice that some transcriptions are interpreted as producing multiphthongs/glides/syllabification, so \".{iii} \" is distinct from mere \".{i} \") and minor differences in place of articulation (trilled \"r\" versus English \"r\", for example) and sometimes voicing (for nasals, rhotics, laterals, and presently xy) do not produce word distinctions; so, they will generate such similarities in Lojban.

Letteral strings which act as numerical/mathematical variables are within the scope of potential reference, but not those which do not (unless they are somehow used in a mathematical expression which is being referenced as a whole); quotations and abstractions behave as the latter case for letteral strings wrt this word. Within a mekso expression, \"{du}\" and other predicates are taken as terminating a numerical expression; this word (unless subscripted; see infra) references completed numerical/mathematical expressions, and thus will not refer to the one in which it itself appears, which should help to avoid self-reference, predication issues, non-terminating loops, nondefinition issues, etc. Thus, it might be useful for recursive definitions. Subscript this word with an integer $n$ in order to refer count $n$ potential referents back (positive $n$ is back-counting, $n = 0$ refers to the current numerical/mathematical expression in which this subscripted word is embedded (once completed and fully evaluated, if such terminates), and negative $n$ is forward-counting). Can be used for quantifying sumti; \"one hundred men and horses\" probably means \"one hundred men and one hundred horses\", and the latter \"one hundred\" can be replaced by this word, because numerical/mathematical expressions which function as quantifiers are nonetheless numerical/mathematical expressions (and tend to be completed). Even in a recursive or self-referential context, once the referenced/pointed-to expression is evaluated, the value which it takes in its most-recent usage is the one which should be substituted in place of this word; use \"{ra'o}\" in order to update it if such is desired (and the value depends to some extent on the new context or other developments).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"PA","g":["most-recent mathematical expression","most-recent numerical expression"]},{"w":"xo'e","d":"elliptical/unspecified number.","n":"See also {no'o}, {tu'o}, {xo}, {zo'e}, {co'e}, and {do'e}.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"PA4","g":["elliptical digit","some"]},{"w":"xo'ei","d":"unary mekso operator: produces a string of n consecutive \"xo'e\"'s, treated as digits (concatenated into a single string of digits)","n":"n can be any nonnegative integer, (countable) infinity, or vague (in which case it could mean a nonnegative integer or (countable) infinity). The default value of n is vague/elliptical, thus transforming this word into a 0-ary operator. The output is a string of digits, not a number; thus, it automatically attaches to a string of PA's if immediately preceding this word; following digits must be concatenated on; it might be necessary to convert this string into a number (especially if it is isolated and/or is being acted upon an operator that is defined as desired for numbers but not for digits or strings), but the conversion may be automatic according to the grammar (at least in some contexts). {xo'e} is considered to represent exactly one 'digit' (really: PA member) in the given base until it is converted into a number. Since {pi} belongs to PA, technically at least zero {xo'e}'s can actually be meant to be radix point(s); at most, the total allowable number of radix points in a digit string, less the number of explicitly mentioned {pi}'s that occur therein (within the macrodigit), is the number of {pi}'s that can be referenced elliptically by this means. {ma'u} and {ni'u} are possible references for microdigits where allowed by the base.

If this word is followed by a number of/evaluated to a value 0 or 1 (preceded immediately by \"li\"), this value is taken to be an explicit reset of the mode to the value indicated (the value in question is called a seed value). Iff the seed value is 1, the mode is set thereinafter to multiplicative style; iff the seed value is 0, the mode is set thereinafter to additive style. (That is: the seed values represent the identity elements under the operation which the mode emulates.).  No other value, numerical or otherwise (including other sumti or even Boolean values, which actually mean \"truth\" and \"false\", rather than \"1\" and \"0\" respectively, despite common representations), may act as a seed value of this word.  Thus, only in the context of this word being followed by a \"li\"-introduced mekso expression X which evaluates to the numbers 0 or 1 wherein X is not intended to be taken as a seed value of this word must this word be followed by {ku} prior to X; in this case there is no explicit seed value. If this word has no explicit seed value, then this word causes the mode of interpretation of double-negatives to switch between multiplicative style and additive style; an utterance of this word switches the mode to whichever of these two options was not being used immediately previously.  Thus, it is its own terminator/negator.  Lojban default (without context) is in multiplicative mode: \"mi na na nelci\" is nearly equivalent to \"mi nelci\"; double-negatives cancel leaving a positive sense (even if it is not entirely/definitively affirmative). So, one utterance of this word (under standard conventions) in a given discourse will change double-negatives to become additive. This mode is similar to (some) Spanish negation or AAVE negation; multiple negatives compound/add together, intensifying the negativity (subjective truth-value) of an utterance.  In additive mode, \"[zau'e'u] mi na na nelci\" is equivalent to \"mi ba'e na nelci\" or something of the like; \"[zau'e'u] mi na na na na nelci\" would be simply further emphasized (roughly twice as emphatic as the previous example's negation).

In order to be well-defined, all elements of $x_2$ united with the singleton of $x_1$ must be ordered according to the ordering endowing $x_4$; if $x_4$ lacks a good order, then $x_1$ is undefined. $x_4$ must be an ordered structure, not simply a set. Warning: If $x_3$ is explicitly filled, that is the only direction which is to be assumed.  If it is not explicitly filled, only one (or, arguably, possibly zero) direction(s) is(/are) to be assumed; in this context, it is to be inferred that the set $x_2$ is (possibly) bounded on at least one side/in at least one direction.  Connecting arguments by 'AND' in $x_3$ implies that $x_2$ is the set formed by the singleton of $x_3$; it is NOT the equivalent to the English term \"bound(ed)\" without qualifiers/adjectives (for that meaning, use modulus/absolute value/norm on the input of $x_1$). The bound is not strict (proposal: use {praperi} for this sense), but must be true of all elements of $x_2$ in that direction ($x_3$); it is not necessarily the extremal/best finite bound on $x_2$. $x_1$ is typically finite; submitting any infinity for it is arguably bad form but would imply that no element of $x_2$ is infinite on the side determined by $x_3$ (where \"infinite\" has meaning determined also by $x_4$; again, for \"finite\", use modulus/absolute value/norm) - no other information (about its being bounded or unbounded) can be discerned (unless the sumti in $x_3$ and/or $x_4$ are incompatible).

Given the other sumti in the predicate (filling the corresponding terbri), the underlying relation (selbri) is claimed to be invalid in this circumstance. Examples: \"non-integrable\", \"non-measurable\" (confer: \".{umre}\"), \"non-summable\" (say, of strings), \"the limit does not exist\". This avoids the necessity of creating a pair of words for every such mathematical concept (one for when the operation may be applied to the inputs so as to yield a well-defined value which may be specified and one for when such is not the case). Other uses may develop or be found. This word does not 'delete' the terbri (unlike \"{zi'o}\"); it simply says that the selbri is not really applicable. Whether or not the meaning of this word is within the generic semantic range of \"{zo'e}\" is debatable and not yet well-established. The conventions employed matter. The case of the product of zero and infinity usually must be handled by a separate definition (especially when dealing only with strictly real numbers); it is quite common to explicitly handle this case by defining the product as zero, but prior to such definition, \"lo pilji be li no bei li ci'i\" is meaningless and undefined (the symbols can be written but do not actually mean anything) - so, $pilji_1$ should be filled with this word in such a circumstance. As another example, unless the difference of infinity with infinity is defined (and following the convention that unconnected points have a graph distance of positive countable infinity), which is unnatural, the relationship represented by \"{tseingu}\" is undefined in its fourth terbri (so, it can be filled with this word) when its first and second sumti belong to mutually different trees (leaving their most recent mutually common ancestor undefined). Notice that the other terbri are well-defined in this circumstance - in particular, $tseingu_3$ is positive countable infinity; also notice that this word has a slightly less mathematical flavor (especially insofar as the first terbri is not result of applying a mathematical operation to the following terbri) than many other ready examples. Yet another example: In a zero-dimensional universe, $klama_4$ and possibly $klama_5$, as well as even more arguably $klama_2$, are undefined (and can be filled with this word), leaving the notion of 'going' empty and meaningless. In a $(-1)$-dimensional universe (an empty set), every terbri of \"{klama}\" (and probably every other word) is undefined and can be filled with this terbri.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"KOhA","g":["non-existent it","undefining it"]},{"w":"zi'e'a","d":"converts a following bu-letteral into a sumti representing the musical natural note with that name.","n":"The next bu-letteral is absorbed and a natural accidental is given to it; e.g. \"zi'e'a gy\" means \"the note G-natural\".

This color is a subset/element (depending on interpretation/usage) of the colors associated with light in the radio and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Speaker determines how close \"approximately twenty-one centimeters\" is to exactly twenty-one centimeters. Technically can only be used for the coloration of light that would arise from the hyperfine spin-flip transition of a hydrogen atom (without any neutrons) in which the proton-electron quantum spin configuration abruptly changes from parallel to antiparallel in the 1s groundstate.  But other isotopes and/or hydrogenic (id est: single-electron) atoms can be referenced by semantic broadening; note that in any case, this word always refers to the color of the light emitted from such an object. This is a color, not a description of the process, conditions under which the light of this color is emitted, etc., nor is it the light itself nor wavelength of the light.  However, this term probably will come up in all such descriptions.  For example, \"hyperfine spin-flip transition\" might be rendered {xipfne binxo}. Technically, any object that emits photons with wavelengths of approximately twenty-one centimeters will be of the color xipfne, regardless of why such emission is occurring (id est: it need not be due to hydrogen hyperfine, proton/electron spin-flip transitions).  Usage in such a case is perfectly acceptable.  However, in practice, such occasions/contexts will be rare (essentially completely absent except in theory) and the only common usage will be in the context of hydrogen hyperfine proton/electron spin-flip transitions (as in astronomy, chemistry, or quantum mechanics). This is an electromagnetic (id est: light, photon) color.  It is physical (being derived from the properties of the wavelength of the emitted and received photon(s)), but is interpreted by some instrument (such as a telescope/camera system, an animal's optical system, etc.).
