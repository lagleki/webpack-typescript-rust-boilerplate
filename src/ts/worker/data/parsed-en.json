When the argument of $x_4$ is 1, the generalized eigenspace $x_3$ is simply a strict/simple/basic eigenspace; this is the typical (and probable cultural default) meaning of this word. $x_4$ will typically be restricted to integer values k > 0. $x_2$ should always be specified (at least implicitly by context), for an eigenvalue does not mean much without the linear transformation being known. However, since one usually knows the said linear transformation, and since the basic underlying relationship of this word is \"eigen-ness\", the eigenvalue is given the primary terbri ($x_1$). When filling $x_3$ and/or $x_4$, $x_2$ and $x_1$ (in that order of importance) should already be (at least contextually implicitly) specified. $x_3$ is the set of all eigenvectors of linear transformation $x_2$, endowed with all of the typical operations of the vector space at hand. The default includes the zero vector (else the $x_3$ eigenspace is not actually a vector space); normally in the context of mathematics, the zero vector is not considered to be an eigenvector, but by this definition it is included. Thus, a Lojban mathematician would consider the zero vector to be an (automatic) eigenvector of the given (in fact, any) linear transformation (particularly ones represented by a square matrix in a given basis). This is the logically most basic definition, but is contrary to typical mathematical culture. This word implies neither nondegeneracy nor degeneracy of eigenspace $x_3$. In other words there may or may not be more than one linearly independent vector in the eigenspace $x_3$ for a given eigenvalue $x_1$ of linear transformation $x_2$. $x_3$ is the unique generalized eigenspace of $x_2$ for given values of $x_1$ and $x_4$. $x_1$ is not necessarily the unique eigenvalue of linear transformation $x_2$, nor is its multiplicity necessarily 1 for the same. Beware when converting the terbri structure of this word. In fact, the set of all eigenvalues for a given linear transformation $x_2$ will include scalar zero (0); therefore, any linear transformation with a nontrivial set of eigenvalues will have at least two eigenvalues that may fill in terbri $x_1$ of this word. The 'eigenvalue' of zero for a proper/nice linear transformation will produce an 'eigenspace' that is equivalent to the entire vector space at hand. If $x_3$ is specified by a set of vectors, the span of that set should fully yield the entire eigenspace of the linear transformation $x_2$ associated with eigenvalue $x_1$, however the set may be redundant (linearly dependent); the zero vector is automatically included in any vector space. A multidimensional eigenspace (that is to say a vector space of eigenvectors with dimension strictly greater than 1) for fixed eigenvalue and linear transformation (and generalization exponent) is degenerate by definition. The algebraic multiplicity $x_5$ of the eigenvalue does not entail degeneracy (of eigenspace) if greater than 1; it is the integer number of occurrences of a given eigenvalue $x_1$ in the multiset of eigenvalues (spectrum) of the given linear transformation/square matrix $x_2$. In other words, the characteristic polynomial can be factored into linear polynomial primes (with root $x_1$) which are exponentiated to the power $x_5$ (the multiplicity; notably, not $x_4$). For $x_4$ > $x_5$, the eigenspace is trivial. $x_2$ may not be diagonalizable. The scalar zero (0) is a naturally permissible argument of $x_1$ (unlike some cultural mathematical definitions in English). Eigenspaces retain the operations and properties endowing the vectorspaces to which they belong (as subspaces). Thus, an eigenspace is more than a set of objects: it is a set of vectors such that that set is endowed with vectorspace operators and properties. Thus {klesi} alone is insufficient. But the set underlying eigenspace $x_3$ is a type of {klesi}, with the property of being closed under linear transformation $x_2$ (up to scalar multiplication). The vector space and basis being used are not specified by this word. Use this word as a seltau in constructions such as \"eigenket\", \"eigenstate\", etc. (In such cases, {te} {aigne} is recommended for the typical English usages of such terms. Use {zei} in lujvo formed by these constructs. The term \"eigenvector\" may be rendered as {cmima} {be} {le} {te} {aigne}).

The ith term in tuple X2 is replaced with the ith term in tuple X3; the replacements are executed simultaneously (thus, no overlap/contradiction can be allowed to arise in the substitution- in particular, in X2)  - alternatively, if there is overlap/conflict in/between the terms of X2, the replacements are performed in order of presentation (the ith term in X2 is replaced by the ith term in X3, and then the (i+1)th term in X2 is replaced with the (i+1)th term in X3, starting with the 1st term in each). X2 and X3 must have the same length/number of terms - alternatively, X3 cannot be longer/have more terms than X2; in this situation, the ith term of X2 is replaced with the ith term of X3 until and including when the last term of X3 is reached, after which point the remaining terms in X2 are not replaced at all. Use a permutation acting on X2 as the argument for X3 in order to rearrange the substrings of X1; if the alphabet is ordered, then operators can be applied to the letters in order to rotate through the alphabet. In particular, if X1 is a binary string (a word over an alphabet of two letters) and X2 is the 2-tuple of the letters of that binary alphabet (length-1 substrings), then without specification of X3, this operator defaults to bitwise binary negation (bit conjugation) wherein each letter in X1 is replaced by the unique other letter in the binary alphabet (otherwise, the replacement would be the identity/trivial replacement or just a formal substitution letter-by-letter which does not really change the nature of the word). X1 and each entry in X2 and X3 should be quoted, match a necessary type (such as being a character), or be abstracted a level by symbolics. In general, the replacement is formal and the strings in X3 need not be over the same alphabet as the one over which X1 is written. This operator is useful for combinatorial lines and for expanding digits (such as, in a binary string, replacing each occurrence of \"0\" with \"01\" and each occurrence of \"1\" with \"10\"; note that the replacement is instantaneous and simultaneous for all terms of X2 and every occurrence of such terms in X1, thus this substitution is perfectly acceptable).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"VUhU","g":["bit conjugation","bitwise binary negation","combinatorial line","digit expansion","find-and-replace"]},"bai'i'i":{"d":"mekso operator: in ordered tuple/list/vector/sequence $X_1$, replace the $X_2$th entry with term $X_3$ of appropriate type, and leave all other entries untouched (optional: where the index for the very first/leading/header entry is $X_4$).","n":"$X_1$ must be some ordered and indexed structure; $X_2$ must be an index which specifies an entry/element/term which actually appears in $X_1$; $X_3$ is an alternative value of appropriate type which can, and after this operation does, replace the $X_2$th entry/element/term; the counting for indices is according to explicitly specified or implicit cultural convention, or the natural convention for the circumstance, or (when ambiguous or unclear) starts with 1, unless $X_4$ specifies otherwise (in which case, it is according to that specification). Exactly the $X_2$th entry is reppaced, and it is replaced with exactly $X_3$. For example: in (A, B, C), A is the $X_4$th entry (default: 1st); bai'i'i((A, B, C), 2, b, 1) = (A, b, C). $X_2$ itself could be replaced with a(n ordered) set of index values, in which case $X_3$ must be an ordered list of replacement values such that they have the same cardinality; in this situation, the $n$th index in the index set (according to its ordering) corresponds to an entry in $X_1$ which gets replaced (respectively) by the $n$th entry in $X_3$, where the entries in $X_3$ are themselves counted/indexed/ordered in the usual manner and with the first/leading/header entry being 1st unless somehow explicitly specified otherwise; the index set is automatically ordered according to the same ordering as on $X_3$ unless explicitly specified otherwise. Example: bai'i'i((A, B, C, D, E, F, G), Set(5, 2), (b, e), 1) = (A, b, C, D, e, F, G), where the ordering on $X_2$ and $X_3$ is the standard ordering starting with 1; note that Set(5, 2) is unordered and that the standard ordering rearranges it as (2, 5) with 2 being the 1st entry/element, meaning that the index 2 (corresponding with B in $X_1$) gets linked with the first entry of $X_3$, which is b, meaning that B gets replaced by b in $X_1$.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"VUhU","g":["find-and-replace"]},"bainri":{"d":"$x_1$ is an executable/binary file to be run in system/runtime environment $x_2$.","n":"A calque on the English word \"binary\".

The space must be ordered or directed in some sense. Let the space X be the traditionally-ordered field of real numbers, and x and y be in X (or x be a geometric point which is represented in such manner and which belongs to a specified line/ray which has a defined positive direction and a specification of the meaning of the length of 1 unit); then, \"x bi'oi y\" represents the interval between x and x + y, where y is signed. In other words, this interval is like the body of the string in the scenario in which one of its endpoints is tacked down at x and the other is dragged out a distance y therefrom in the directions specified by the signum of y (with the string being pulled taut and being of length exactly y). Maintaining the same notation and continuing discussion of \"x bi'oi y\": if the clusivity for the first term (or 'on the left') is specified, then x is or is not included in the referenced interval as specified; if the clusivity for the second term (or 'on the right') is specified, then x + y is or is not included in the referenced interval as specified (note: this does not generally indicate whether y is included in the referenced interval). Units, particularly for y, must be explicit when appropriate. In a connected acyclic directed graph, x would be a node and y would be the graph-geodesic distance therefrom in the direction (if y is positive), or in the opposite direction (if y is negative), of the graph. This definition enables the ISO 8601 standard for time interval specification in the cases (1) of a starting time/pastward endpoint (namely x) and a duration (y: y > 0), and (2) of an ending time/futureward endpoint (namely x) and a duration (y: y < 0), where notation for \"x\" and \"y\" (in the usage \"x bi'oi y\") is continued from the earlier discussion in this note in the case of the number lines or the real; note that, in this usage case, x is a point in time (a timestamp) and y is a duration (elapsed time or measure of time, and which thus has explicitly specified units or something akin to the ISO 8601 standard notation for durations). See this proposal for more information on related topics: https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Proposal:_loi_lerfu_tcita_detri;_the_final_word_on_the_problem_of_dates_and_times%3F . Importantly, the ISO 8601 standard in the case of an ending time and a duration has the terms expressed in the order of y followed by x with y being positive; when this word is used for such purposes, y must be negative, but the order of x and y may be exchanged via usage of \"{se}\" (resulting in \"{sebi'oi}\"). Generally, the distinction between points/'positions' (represented by x) and measures/vectors/'displacements'/'translation vectors' (represented by y), in the sense of affine spaces, must be maintained when using this word. See also: \"{bi'o}\", \"{bi'i}\", \"{mi'i}\", \"{bi'oi'au}\", and https://mw-live.lojban.org/papri/Extended_Dimensionality_of_Interval_cmavo .","t":"cmavo","s":"BIhI","g":["affine space interval given by position and translation vector","ordered interval given by endpoint and signed measure","tack-and-drag ordered interval"]},"bi'oi'au":{"d":"digit/number: interval/range indicator for significant digits (determined by lesser endpoint).","n":"Given a well-formed digit string \"$x_{n} x_{n-1} ... x_{m}$ bi'oi'au $x_{m-1} x_{m-2} ...$\", where (a) \"$x_i$\" is a member of selma'o PA (other than this word or similar words; including at most one instance of \"{pi}\") for all $i$, and (b) the string represents$^{*_{1}}$ a finite number in base-$b$ (with $b$ taken to be ten by cultural convention in most human cases unless explicitly specified otherwise), the usage of this word in the aforementioned digit string yields an output of the interval $[\\sum_{i = 0}^{\\infty}{(x_{n-i} b^{n-i})}, \\, b^{m} + \\sum_{i = 0}^{\\infty}{(x_{n-i} b^{n-i})})$, after adjusting for \"$x_k$\" in the original string being \"{pi}\" or \"{pi'e}\" vel sim. for at least one $k$ (because that does not work in the summation notation without adjustment); notice the placement of the comma in the interval and clusivity of the endpoints thereof (lesser endpoint is included, but the greater one is excluded). Therefore, using/under the aforementioned notation and assumptions and specifications, usage of this word in \"$x_{n} x_{n-1} ... x_{m}$ bi'oi'au $x_{m-1} x_{m-2} ...$\" outputs an interval which is equivalent to the evaluation of/interval referenced by \"eval(\"$x_{n} x_{n-1} ... x_{m} x_{m-1} x_{m-2} ...$\") {ga'o} {bi'oi} {ke'i} $b^{m}$\". Importantly, usage of this word generates an interval, not a specific number (even if such would be elliptical or vague) - meaning, among other things, that equality to such an expression would be set equality, and not numeric equality. Note that the interval which is generated includes the lesser (left) endpoint (which is the number specified by the string with this word ignored in/removed from it) but excludes the greater (right) endpoint (which is the same number plus some integer power of the base $b$). As an example, where \"B\" represents this word: \"2B000\" yields [2000, 3000); meanwhile, \"20B00\" yields [2000, 2100); also, \"10.2B7\" yields [10.27, 10.37). This word/function is useful for dates (example: \"the 2000s\"), ages (example: \"they are in their twenties\"), or any estimate wherein the significant digits are known. Note that, for example, this functionality supports simple calendrical centuries (example: \"1900 to 2000, exclusive of the latter only\"), canonical calendrical centuries (example: \"1901 to 2001, exclusive of the latter only\"), and complicated century-long time intervals (example: \"1969 to 2069, exclusive of the latter only\"); and analogy applies, of course. The interval which is generated is a complete (math jargon) subset of the real numbers - there are no gaps and, in particular, the interval is not discrete (for example: it is not restricted to only the integers). Note that this word does not yield an interval of an arbitrary length; use \"{bi'oi}\", \"{bi'i}\", or \"{bi'o}\" for that. Use a construct similar to \"there exists a $t$ in (the interval) {re} bi'oi'au {mu} such that their age is measured to be (approximately) $t$ in years\" in order to express \"they are in their twenties (at least 20 years old and less than 30 years old)\"; the full English expression is wordy, but Lojban can make it concise in translation. See also: \"{bi'oi}\", \"{mi'i'au}\", \"{su'ai}\". (Footnote #1: this entire commentary section assumes that the method of interpretation is via a big-endian, traditional, unbalanced, positional, base-$b$ numerical-representation system with $b$ being an integer such that $b > 1$; however, the method of interpretation can be extended to other systems, such as $p$-adics or such as balanced integer or complex base-$b$ systems, in natural and fairly self-evident ways, although no endeavor shall be made herein in order to do so and the assumptions about $b$ and the method of interpretation should be as aforementioned, ignoring such possibilities for extension).","t":"cmavo","s":"PA","g":["interval-from-number determined by lesser endpoint"]},"bi'orka":{"d":"$x_1$ is a birch of species $x_2$","n":"See {tricu}.

Note that if the weights are all $1$ and $x_2$ is set equal to not the $p$th-power function, but instead the $p$th-power function left-composed with the absolute value function (or the forward difference function), then the result is the $p$-norm on $x_2$ scaled by $n^{(-1/p)}$ for integer $n$ being the cardinality of $x_2$. This should typically not refer to the mean of a function ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_of_a_function ), although it generalizes easily; alternatively, with appropriate weighting, allow $x_2$ to be the image (set) of the function whose average is desired over the entire relevant subset of its domain - notice that the weights will have to themselves be functions of the data or the domain of the function; in this context, the function is not necessarily $x_3$. If $x_3$ is a single extended-real number $p$ (not a function), then this word refers to the weighted power-mean and it is equivalent to letting $x_2$ equal the $p$th-power function as before iff $p$ is nonzero real, the $max$ or $min$ as before if $p$ is infinite (according to its signum as before), and $log$ if $p$=$0$ (thus making the overall mean refer to the geometric mean); this overloading is for convenience of usage and will not cause confusion because constant functions are very much so not injective.","t":"fu'ivla","g":["arithmetic mean","average","generalized f-mean","generalized mean","geometric mean","harmonic mean","log-sum-exponential","LSE","max","mean","mean value","min","norm","norm","p-norm","power mean","quasi-arithmetic mean","RMS","root-mean-square","typical"]},"cnanlagau":{"d":"$x_1$ is the generalized arithmetic-geometric mean of the elements of the 2-element set $x_2$ (set; cardinality must be 2) of order $x_3$ (either single extended-real number xor an unordered pair/2-element set of extended-real numbers).","n":"Elements of $x_2$ must have the same units/dimensionality; the result has the same units/dimensionality as them.

Might include sign language words or cheremes, although a more explicit word for linguistically organized and “full” cheremes is preferred (and especially for the sign language as a whole). x1 is possibly best typed by {nu} and/or {si'o}. x4 might be best expressed as an event; for example, it could be \"the event of the right hand touching the chest near the heart, with fist clenched\" for a salute, whereas/wherein x3 would be merely the fist/hand (and the chest near the heart).

It is possible therefore to reference both primed and unprimed objects of form A simultaneously via reference to, for example, (1±1)/2 for the value for B and/or C (employing the setting of defaulting to the value of 1 as appropriate).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"VUhU","g":["append prime mark"]},"da'acre":{"d":"$x_{1}$ is an expert-fight with opponent [in fight] $x_{2}$ with expertise standard $x_{3}$.","t":"lujvo","g":["fighting expert"]},"da'ai":{"d":"other than me","n":"Can include {do}. {ma'a} can be defined as \"{mi} {jo'u} {do} jo'u {da'ai}\"","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"KOhA3","g":["not me"]},"da'ai'a":{"d":"\"da'avni\" modal: except under condition ...; unless ...; excepting/exempting (condition) ... .","n":"See also: \"{da'avni}\".

Thus, the indices/labels specified are included in the range of sampling; id est: if the matrix entries listed belong to the ith row and jth column and the (i+n)th row and (j+m)th column respectively (for positive integers i,j,n,m), then the sampling will be conducted in all rows of number between (and including) i and i+n (yielding n+1 sampled rows) and in all columns of number between (and including) j and j+m (yielding m+1 sampled columns). The default diagonal sampling procedure for x4 is as follows: The first sampled entry has the minimum allowed (as specified in x3) indices.  All latter sampled entries (by default) have indices of the immediately previous sampled entry each augmented by 1. (Which is to say that if the kth sampled entry has indices (x,y,...), in that order, then the (k+1)th sampled entry has indices (x+1,y+1,...), in that order and where each subsequent index would be the respective index of the kth sampled entry augmented by 1).  The process terminates generally whenever exactly one entry is sampled from each of the rows, each of the columns, etc. of the tensor.  In the default, the process terminates when at least one of the indices of a sampled entry of the tensor is as large as possible in the range specified by x3. Thus, in order to reconcile the general and the default termination conditions, the range specified by x3 must be compatible with both; id est: it must be a r-dimensional hypercube of entries, so to speak, where r is the rank of tensor x2. The default for sampling range x3 is between and including the entry in the first row and first column (etc.) and the entry in the last row and last column (etc.) for an r-dimensional hypercube tensor (meaning that each row, column, etc. of the tensor has exactly the same number of entries as the others).  Generally, the default range begins with the entry of indices each minimal in the tensor (called 'the first entry') and extends to include (\"draw\") the maximal r-dimensional hypercube of entries in the tensor with one vertex on the first entry; in other words, if the minimum of the set of maximal indices in the tensor is g, then the sampling range is every row between the first and the gth, every column between the first and the gth, etc.  Generally, the sampling range must be an r-dimensional orthotope of some positive size (that is to say: including at least one entry) no larger than the tensor itself, but with the freedom to place at most r of its vertices among the entries thereof; if the default sampling procedure x4 is being used, then the r-dimensional orthotope must be an r-dimensional hypercube. Generalizes to any tensor, but is only interesting for tensors of rank at least 1.

The immediately following (next) unfilled terbri at that level of nesting is affected by this word; if no such terbri exists at that level of nesting, this word's affects apply to the next unfilled terbri in the immediately higher level of nesting (unnested once); if no unfilled terbri exist at any/all levels of nesting and following the immediately previous sumti (even if unfilled terbri exist prior to that sumti), this word has no meaningful affect and can be ignored.  This word must be followed by a sumti; for the purpose of this explanation, this sumti will be xy (as in \"de'ai xy\").  The affected terbri is defined to default to the value xy (the sumti as a whole, including gadri, tanru, relative clauses, etc.); in other words, when not explicitly filled or when filled be {di'au}, the sumti value filling the affected terbri is that of xy.  This affect remains in effect until the end of the text/conversation or until/unless the default setting of this terbri explicitly redefined (overriding by {di'ei} is temporary/only applies to that usage). If xy is {zo'e}, the default value is completely general and elliptical; thus, permanently overriding a default setting on a specific terbri may be done by \"de'ai zo'e\". The scope of this word fully encompasses and ends with the following sumti (xy); thus, the second sumti, same-/higher-level terminator, a FA cmavo, etc. following this word ends the new default specification in addition to its other functions.  Additionally, this word does not actually fill the affected terbri with any particular sumti/value; it merely defines its default value hereinafter. CAUTION: Thus, the second same-level sumti uttered actually fills the affected terbri; in order to access the newly-defined default value of the terbri immediately after definition, follow \"xy\" (with terminator) immediately with implicit (or possibly explicit) \"{zo'e}\" (possibly necessitating terminators), \"{di'au}\", or \"xy\" itself. Moreover, therefore, the default value defined by this word does not immediately/necessarily affect the truth value of the statement in which it appears (it only does so if the second following sumti is not {di'au}, implicit (or possibly) explicit {zo'e}, or xy itself); however, in all future uses of the brivla to which the terbri belongs, unless explicitly filled with a sumti of a different value, the truth value of those statements will be affected.  Also, {su} does not erase this new definition of default. If the affected terbri is naturally defined to have a default or if it has no naturally defined default value, this word semi-permanently over-writes them.

For example, \"li pa ce'o li re\" means \"big-endian\" (the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes first in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li pa\" means \"little-endian\" ((the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes last in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li ci ce'o le pa\" is middle-endian (as in the conventional representation of dates in the U.S. (MM-DD-YYYY); the second most signifant term (represented by \"li re\"; example: month) comes first, the least significant term (represented by \"li ci\"; example: day) comes second, and the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\"; example: year) comes last, and there are exactly three terms), \"li pa ce'o li ci ce'o li re\" is the reverse of the last (example: YYYY-DD-MM). The point is that, while it is cumbersome, this method of filling $x_2$ is generalizable and explicit. \"Bi-endian\" (traditional sense) can be specified by a judicious usage of the word \".{a}\" between the little-endian and big-endian sequences; less conventional endiannesses which could be described as being \"bi-endian\" or even \"$n$-endian\" can be formed by different or more elaborate connectives between such sequences; just worry about grouping of connectives.

Caution must be used: matrix addition or scalar multiplication of matrices already have this distributional property, so this word is not needed in those cases; in fact, A+(fau'a)A would yield ((1+A, 2+A), (3+A, 4+A)), which is nonsensical (because, without \"fau'a\", the addition of a scalar entry to a matrix is undefined).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"FAUhA","g":["distribution of function to entries","entrywise function application"]},"fa'u'ai":{"d":"non-logical connective: antirespectively; unmixed but reverse ordered distributed association.","n":"Works together with {fa'u}; given an ordering by {fa'u}, the terms connected by this word are (applied) in opposite order.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"JOI","g":["and antirespectively","anti-respectively","antirespectively"]},"fau'ai":{"d":"Iteratively applies \"fau'a\" to each resultant operator until all operators resolve.","n":"Let matrix A = ((1, 2), (3, 4)); then A +(fau'ai) A = A +({fau'a}*) A = ((1 +(fau'a*) A, 2 +(fau'a*) A), (3 +(fau'a*) A, 4 +(fau'a*) A)) = (( ((1+1, 1+2), (1+3, 1+4)), ((2+1, 2+2),(2+3, 2+4)) ), ( ((3+1, 3+2), (3+3, 3+4)), ((4+1, 4+2), (4+3, 4+4)) )), which has all of the additions resolve (so the iteration terminates) - the result is a 2-by-2 matrix in which each entry is itself a 2-by-2 matrix.

Making Type 4 {fu'ivla} (or {zi'evla}), on the other hand, presents the challenge of knowing, out of hundreds of wordlike phonological patterns, which will parse as  single-morpheme words and which will not. (For example, the nonce word {kadvati} will parse but *{kazvati} will not; {fra'aso} will but *{fra'asoi} will not; {kadnazbakai} will but {kadnazbackai} is a actually a lujvo.)

If $m$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $m = 0$. This function/word first determines the base being used for interpretation of digit strings (determined by context or by explicit specification (JUhAU)) for/as applied to $x$; this determination takes place even before inputs are accepted after $x$; let this base be represented by $b$ throughout this description unless $b$ is explicitly specified as an input. In such case, if the base of $x$ is a positional system wherein each digit represents a corresponding multiple of a fixed natural number raised to the power of its position (as determined relative to the radix point) and wherein the overall number is the sum of these results/representands, or if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is defined; if the base of $x$ is sufficiently bad or unclear and $b$ is not explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is undefined. Of course, if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then that value (if valid) is the meaning of \"$b$\" throughout this description. If $t$ is undefined, then its slot is automatically and implicitly deleted from this word in that context (so the operator is at-most-3-ary and its input acceptance is terminated by the '$n$' xor '$m$' slot, whichever one is later yet defined (because, assumptively, '$b$' is not explicitly specified); if '$m$' is defined and explicitly uttered when '$t$' is undefined and the '$x$' and '$n$' values have been explicitly specified, then the third input is '$m$') and \"$b^t$\" $=$ \"$b^{(-t)}$\" $= b = 1$ formally for the purposes of this definition (but not necessarily for the base for any digit-to-number interpretation/conversion, particularly on $x$!). If $t$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $t = 0$. The rounding function, determined by $n$, is performed on $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$. If $n = 1$, then the rounding function is the ceiling function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the least integer that is greater than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds up. If $n = -1$, then the rounding function is the floor function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the greatest integer that is less than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds down. These integers are both determined by the ordering and metric. If $n = 0$, then the rounding function maps $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ to the integer that minimizes the metric distance between itself and $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ if a unique such integer exists (id est: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the nearest integer, where \"nearest\"-ness is determined according to the order and metric); if no such unique integer exists, then $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the unique integer among these aforementioned options for which there exists an integer $Z$ such that $2Z+m$ is the integer in question; if no unique such integer exists, then the function is undefined. Thus, $n = 0$ produces the commonly used unbiased nearest-integer rounding function. In each of these cases, the output of the rounding function is then multiplied by sgn$(x) b^{t}$. Thus, it rounds at the $t$th digit if $b$ matches the base of $x$ and else to the nearest multiple of $b$ in the $t$th digit of abs$(x)$, so to speak. Notice that rounding up or down always is applied to the absolute value, so it is really rounding (positive or negative) infinity-ward or zeroward respectively. The order on, and the operators and metric endowing, the metric space and field of all real numbers is determined by context or by explicit specification. The absolute value function is denoted as \"abs( )\" in the definition, and the signum function sgn is such that sgn$(z) = z/$abs$(z)$ for all real $z:$ abs$(z) > 0$, and sgn$(0) = 0$.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"VUhU","g":["ceiling function","floor function","nearest integer function","round down","rounding function","round to nearest integer","round up"]},"ji'i'u'u":{"d":"mekso, at-most-5-ary; rounding function.

In other words, where \"ji'i'u\" really rounds toward or away from $0$, this word rounds toward negative or positive infinity. The behaviors coincide for nonnegative $x$, but differ for $x < 0$; for example, for $x < 0$, a 'negative-type' rounding for \"ji'i'u\" would round toward $0$, which is actually an increase in value (just decrease in absolute value) while remaining negative, whereas a 'negative-type' rounding here would round toward negative infinity, which is a decrease in value (but an increase in absolute value) while remaining negative.

The construct as a whole syntactically functions as a parenthetical so that mekso may be resumed immediately thereafter without any difficulty. This word attaches to/affects the immediately preceding macrodigit string extending from the last evaluated number, number operation, etc. or bracket to/until this word. The preceding number is semantically interpreted according to the description to which the following sumti refers. If a sequence is supplied as the following sumti, the preceding number is interpreted so that each digit, starting from the left (default: see next), is understood as a multiple of the corresponding value in the sequence under the ordering given (which may produce an invalid/ill-formed result; the placement of {pi} matters as well).  If a single number is submitted (such as \"li {dau}\"), this word acts as {ju'u}; the number is interpreted according to the rules of mekso and is its own island for such interpretation (thus {ju'u} is needed to override a cultural/grammatical default interpretation, such as decimal, even if this is done within the mekso expression outside of and including the scope of this word). In this way, the sumti being (10^n)_n, which is a sequence, is the same as the sumti being just 10, but is very different from it being the sequence (10)_n.  The original default for numeral-position/string reading/interpretation is from left-to-right, where a digit on the left in a pair of digits represents that multiple of a \"later\" term in the sequence as compared to right member of the pair; thus \"23\" in decimal means (2*(10^1)) + (3*(10^0)), which is twenty-three.

By default, the macrodigit is interpreted as being written/expressed in some cultural or grammatical default (this default is overridden by {ju'au} if its specifying sumti requires an alternative interpretation for the value of the macrodigits), probably decimal- the interpretation of the string of microdigits produces a number, x; the \"{pi'e}\" implies the denominator to be used in determining the fraction for which x is in the numerator and context or possibly a specified base determines its value- in timekeeping, the interpretation is typically x/60 for certain macrodigits. However, the default for determining the value of x given a string of microdigits might be useful to override (for example, Tsohnai uses an overall factorial base but each macrodigit is written in balanced quinary); this word specifies the base used for interpreting the macrodigit from a string of microdigits. It is placed at the end of the string (possibly before the next \"{pi'e}\") and its scope of effect extends from there, through the string of microdigits, to either the beginning of the number as a whole or the most recent \"{pi'e}\" (whichsoever was more recently uttered). It is to be followed by a sumti (or multiple sumti strung together by connectives) and has its scope of specification terminate with that sumti; in this regard, it works syntactically and semantically exactly like {ju'au}. In fact, {ju'au} can be used outside of the number in order to specify the macrodigit interpretation instead of this word (for example, if its sumti were la .tsonais., this word would not be needed); however, if only a sequence were to have been given as the argument of {ju'au} (such as the factorial sequence) and if some base other than decimal were desired for the interpretation of each macrodigit from the string of microdigits, then this word would be used. If only one macrodigit appears in the number, then this word is equivalent to {ju'au}.

Technically, $x_1$ (therefore, also $x_2$) and $x_3$ are mutually so, as well. However, $x_3$ will typically be used in order to identify the 'side of the family tree/genealogy' being considered and $x_2$ will typically be the focal point at which the several sides of family trees (including the considered one) intersect (being otherwise disjoint); as such, $x_2$'s paternal uncle will not be described as being $x_2$'s father's brother on $x_2$'s side of the tree. In other words, there is a large family tree with at least two 'sides' and they intersect at exactly one node; this node of intersection is canonically to typically be $x_2$ and $x_3$ is canonically to typically be used to designate which of these possible sides is being considered such that $x_1$ belongs to it. (Symmetry is enabled by the fact that the only inferrable family tree is the 'side' produced; the larger family tree is unknown, and so the collection of potential sides amongst which the specification is taken is also unknown). The largest family tree (graph union of all sides of the mentioned relatives) is the graph which the utterer and/or relatives mentioned consider to be the entirety of the family of all the relatives mentioned (plus some near relatives, so long as they belong to exactly one side); thus, it may include marriages, god-children, close friends, and exes, but it is unlikely to span over many generations. For example, maternal and paternal sides of families are considered to be separate sides of the family tree for a child, even if in the distant unknown past, that father and that mother share some sort of familial relationship (even including a biological common ancestor). This word can be used to hint at a path in the graph from $x_1$ to $x_2$, since there exists a path which connects them and which also includes $x_3$; therefore, it can be used to vaguely mean \"my onclic aunt-in-law by my Uncle John\" meaning that the referent is the utterer's Uncle John's wife's sister (or sister in law); use connectives in $x_3$ in order to include (if the connective means \"AND\") more nodes which must have paths (not necessarily the same ones) running through them from $x_1$ to $x_2$. This word does not actually specify any of the relations between $x_1$, $x_2$, or $x_3$ arguments; it merely claims that they are all related and belong to a common (effective) family tree.

Therefore, using/under the aforementioned notation and assumptions and specifications, usage of this word in \"$x_{n} x_{n-1} ... x_{m}$ mi'i'au $x_{m-1} x_{m-2} ...$\" outputs an interval which is equivalent to the evaluation of/interval referenced by \"eval(\"$x_{n} x_{n-1} ... x_{m} x_{m-1} x_{m-2} ...$\") {ga'o} {mi'i} {ke'i} $b^{m}$\". Importantly, usage of this word generates an interval, not a specific number (even if such would be elliptical or vague) - meaning, among other things, that equality to such an expression would be set equality, and not numeric equality. Note that the interval which is generated excludes both endpoints but includes the center (which is the number specified by the string with this word ignored in/removed from it). As an example, where \"M\" represents this word: \"2M000\" yields (1000, 3000); meanwhile, \"20M00\" yields (1900, 2100); also, \"19M69\" yields (1869, 2069); likewise, \"1.2M3\" yields (1.13, 1.33). This word/function is useful for dates (example: \"the mid-2000s\" or \"the period of two centuries which is centered on the year 1900\"), ages (example: \"they are in their mid-twenties\", \"they are older teens or young adults (fifteen to twenty-five years of age)\", or \"they are in their middle adult years (thirties or forties)\"), or any estimate wherein the midpoint/expected value/average is known. The interval which is generated is a complete (math jargon) subset of the real numbers - there are no gaps and, in particular, the interval is not discrete (for example: it is not restricted to only the integers). Note that this word does not yield an interval of an arbitrary radius; use \"{mi'i}\" for that. Use a construct similar to \"there exists a $t$ in (the interval) {re} {mu} mi'i'au such that their age is measured to be (approximately) $t$ in years\" in order to express \"they are in their mid-twenties (approximately 24 years old to 26 years old)\"; the full English expression is wordy, but Lojban can make it concise in translation. See also: \"{mi'i}\", \"{bi'oi'au}\", \"{su'ai}\". (Footnote #1: this entire commentary section assumes that the method of interpretation is via a big-endian, traditional, unbalanced, positional, base-$b$ numerical-representation system with $b$ being an integer such that $b > 1$; however, the method of interpretation can be extended to other systems, such as $p$-adics or such as balanced integer or complex base-$b$ systems, in natural and fairly self-evident ways, although no endeavor shall be made herein in order to do so and the assumptions about $b$ and the method of interpretation should be as aforementioned, ignoring such possibilities for extension).","t":"cmavo","s":"PA","g":["interval-from-number determined by midpoint digit"]},"miiaumis":{"d":"Pertaining to the Miami/Maumee River or area in Ohio.","n":"The Maumee drains into Lake Erie near Toledo, Ohio.","t":"cmevla","g":["Maumee","Miami"]},"mi'idbo":{"d":"$x_1$ is centrist ideology of $x_2$; $x_2$ is a centrist","n":"cf. {mi'i}, {sidbo}.

For singly-marked quotes (such as by \"{zo}\") it means that the presented quote/string/expression is complete on both ends (including being the complete word / all relevant rafsi in a lujvo).

For example in English: \"I ain't seen nothin'\" means that the speaker is very emphatically claiming to have seen nothing of interest. This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. \"Multiplicative negation\" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). \"I did not see nothing\" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. \"I like cheese\" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to \"I do not dislike cheese\", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another (\"I am indeed very much so going!\" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, \"I am going\"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement (\"I am indeed - not - going\" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to \"I may be going\"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer (\"I am indeed not going\" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"NEIhAI","g":["double-negative mode toggle"]},"nei'au":{"d":"unary mekso operator: $(-1)^x$","n":"Macro for exponentiating -1 by the input, which is an extremely common term.

The number of polytope 'tiles' used can be specified in the third of fifth terbri as desired; the polytopes used need not all be the same, nor regular, so long as the arrangement is meaningful and possible. One of the main differences between rectangular polyplets and polyominoes is that polyominoes cannot have their polytope tiles touching only at their vertices whereas polyplets can (thus, polyominoes are a subset of the rectangular polyplets); this difference can be specified in the final terbri. A tiling of a space may be considered to be an infinite polyform, but that is rather pathological and we can reasonably assume that polyforms referenced by this word will be finite. The polyform is considered to be a unified whole entity. The ambient space is usually going to be the Euclidean space of the same dimension as the polytopes (and the former dimension cannot be exceeded by the latter except in the marginal case of lower-dimensional (id est: hyperplanar) arrangements, in which case parallel cross-sections are really being considered); this space determines the rigid-motion/symmetry isomorphisms of various polyforms (Z and S tetraminoes are non-isomorphic under rigid-motion in the Euclidean plane but are so isomorphic in Euclidean 3-space). The ambient space also determines the expression of (and indeed the 'allowed') polytopes: spherical geometry allows for digons to be arranged so as to form a polyform, but Euclidean 2-space prohibits such objects from the set of possible polygons. The default polytope will probably be a 2-dimensional square; thus the default ambient space will likely be Euclidean 2-space.

When it is well-defined (and the inputs, excluding $m$ are fixed by context), denote $z_{m} = -i * ext((A,<),i,n)|_{m}$.

Inside the module formed by the \"sei'au\" brackets, at most three sumti (where this counting contracts connected sumti into one) can be specified. The first one is a {mau'au}-{zai'ai} quoted function (which is taken to be the operand of this word); it must be preceded (not necessarily immediately) by {li}; let f be this function. The second and third sumti each are a nonnegative integer (preceded by {li}); call them $n$ and $m$ respectively; $n$ defaults to 1 and $m$ defaults to the next (thus-far unfilled) terbri number for/of the current selbri unless these specifications are overridden by zmico; if the relevant selbri has no terbri following this word, then this default value of $m$ causes this word to have no effect. The $m$th terbri of the selbri to which this construct applies will be passed through f before being filled by any sumti (including {zo'e}, explicit or implicit; terbri numbers start counting at 1 and increase by 1 with each new occurrence) for the next $n$ occurrences of the aforementioned selbri in the discourse (with $n$ = 1 counting the current occurrence; aside: a non-default value of $m$ can thus affect the interpretation of an already-filled terbri of the currently open selbri in an afterthought manner); this counting is only done forward in the discourse/time, including the current selbri, never back through it. Thus, $n$ = 0 effectively neutralizes this word, $n$ being infinite causes the effect to be permanent. f being {zi'a'o} returns the terbri in question to its default value/understanding (according to zmico). It is important to realize that this word does not affect the $m$th terbri of all selbri, just of the one currently open when this word is utterred (no matter where it is positioned/nested in future costructs). If this word is in conflict with another usage of this word over the same terbri, follow the specification applied by the most recent still active occurrence of this construct; this construct is considered to be active for this purpose until its-$n$ occurrences of the appropriate terbri are uttered; thus if the earlier-$n$ is greater than the later-$n$, the later effect takes precedent until it is disactivated, after which point the earlier effect resumes. Define $n$ and  $m$ (and f) outside of the module created by brackets of this word if you wish to reuse them; for the sake of future referencing the value specified within the module, $n$ gets reduced/decremented by 1 at each occurrence of the appropriate terbri until it reaches the value 0 (at which value it remains forever after); if $n$ is a series of connected numbers, this decrementation is applied to each connectand in turn. Use {pi'u} (possibly subscripted) in order to simplify utterances. Especially helpful if f is non-injective. The affected terbri must be referenced by {ce'u} as an operand of f wheresoever it is desired; this reference must be explicit.  Let 'broda' be the currentry open selbri; then this word replaces $broda_m$ with f($broda_m$) in the definition of 'broda' for the next $n$ occurrences of the terbri. For example, if f were {cu'a}, then any sumti which fills $broda_m$ will be understood to be doing so in absolute value.

'la .ralf. se'u'o xi li re ce li ci pi'u li re cebo li ci klama by boi cy' = 'Did Ralph come to B from C or to C from B?' (notably, 'Did B come to Ralph from C?' is not a possible option for answering the question). An answer is a SE string that is allowed by the selbri and by the subscripts; continuing the example, if the response is 'Ralph went to C from B', one would respond with '.i {setese}'.  Any SE word works for the general question possibility (which is the unrestricted/non-subscripted case). Essentially 'se'u'o xi sy' is equivalent to 'se xi li xo poi ke'a cmima sy' (where '{te}' is basically understood as ' se xi li jo'i pa boi ci te'u ', etc.), but the answer can be a complicated ordered sequence/string of SE words; this word complements specifically {fi'a} in the typical/same way that SE complements FA. Typically, leaving the subscripted set vague or not completely free of every possible semantic or syntactic pathology is perfectly fine; syntax and practicality will typically restrict it enough for reasonable responses to be made.

Each subsequent sumti contains or possesses the previous one(s), except the first, as a node or location (or subunit) and is only slightly larger/broader than it/them. There is no fixed meaning to any given slot; they just collectively possess this 'zooming-out' property. For example: In \"Cupboard under the stairs, 4, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey, England, UK, northern hemisphere, Earth\", each term separated by commas would be its own separate sumti (and we could continue to widen the scope beyond Earth); note that \"4\" is a name and identifies a house. Postal codes or ZIP codes should be used with caution in this word - they must be inserted in the correct spot; for example, (in the U.S.) a standard ZIP code identifies (approximately) the administering post office or municipal region and, therefore, must come after a street name but usually before the city name; ZIP+4 usually identifies a subdivision of the city or service area for the local post office, so it would come after the street name but before the city name and the standard ZIP code; ZIP+4+2 is usually enough to identify a building, so it would precede the street name (but may follow the apartment number in some cases); going the other way: the first few digits identify the region of the country or type of high-level administrative subunit of the U.S. and would come somewhere after the state name or similar. Containment is not assumed to be proper, so consecutive sumti may be equivalent (for example ZIP+4+2 can be equivalent to the house/building identifier and street address, but may be strictly contain the apartment identifier). Delete $x_1$ in order to talk of things like \"Chesterfield, New Hampshire\" (tcaudu$_2$ = Chesterfield, tcaudu$_3$ = New Hampshire); in this case, since the terbri structure of this word (after tcaudu$_1$) is constant/symmetric wrt shift in sumti slot (indexing), it may be cleanest and most elegant to begin the bridi with the selbri. Any number of consecutive unfilled sumti slots (after tcaudu$_1$) is technically equivalent but may be used informally in order to show that the utterer has a well-defined or standard sequence of nested classes which subdivide the subsequent sumti and which contain the previous ones. Deleting any finite number of sumti slots after the first has no nontrivial effect.

This happens on structure c, which defines what various values and limits mean. b is the 'order' of the result of this convergence (so that it is the bth-order integral (equivalently, -bth-order derivative) of the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a so that b = -1 yields the Dirac delta 'function' centered/with interesting point at 0, b = 0 yields the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a centered at/with interesting point 0, etc.).  Natural numbers (or 0) for b yield a 'special' polynomial (let us call it p) of that order in indeterminant a for all values of a greater than 0 and 0 for all values of a less than 0 so that p(a) = a^b Theta(a). Input e is for when the particular functions in d are of interest and only e of them have been computed (so that, for finite e, the output is not exactly the bth order Heaviside function); in other words, the limit of the family indices is being taken to e; this is of particular importance for negative values of b: |b| > 1, since they will not be identically 0 in some sense (else, all information is lost about the special structure/nature of this function). The contextless defaults are: b = 0, c is the field of real numbers (with absolute value norm and ordering due to signed absolute value), d is bth-order integral of ((1 + y + z * erf(k a / (2^(1/2)) ) ) / 2)-like functions that are properly normalized and are of proper height, e is infinity (countable). Heaviside(0,0,...,f_0) = 1/2 = f_0 is typical and is a contextless default for b = 0 (however, it may in particular be set to 0 or 1 so that the function is left-/right-continuous at a = 0; for values of b other than 0, f_b = 0 is the contextless default; note that f_(-1) must be infinity 'of the proper magnitude' (it cannot be specified to be otherwise).

So, if $x_1$ is a set or a complicated sumti string composed via connectives, then $x_5 = 1$ constructs a singleton set containing $x_1$ and then the referent drawn is, necessarily, $x_1$; meanwhile, if $x_5 = 2$, then some member of $x_4$ itself, excluding $x_1$ (whatsoever it may be), is the referent which is drawn; for the purposes of $x_5$, $x_1$ and $x_4$ are treated asymmetrically, for the sake of utility and minimal complication.

This word can be used to specify the concept of \"$n$th cousin $m$-times removed\"-ness; $x_1$ and $x_2$ would be the cousins, $x_3-1 = n$, and $x_4$ is closely related to $m$ but is signed. If one views the tree graphs to which $x_1$ and $x_2$ belong with the viewing perspective such that siblings and spouses are mutually separated horizontally and such that ancestors are separated from their descendants vertically (with ancestors in the positive direction relative to their descendants), then $x_3$ is the unsigned horizontal distance between $x_1$ and $x_2$. Additionally, $x_4$ is, approximately, the signed generational offset/difference between subjects $x_1$ and $x_2$; it is their signed 'vertical' difference under the aforementioned viewing perspective and sign convention. The relationship need not actually be cousinhood  (as perceived by English); direct ancestor-descendant pairs, (aunt/uncle)-(niece/nephew) pairs, and in fact any pair of family members with a well-specified most recent common ancestor (that is known) have this relationship to one another. This word can be used for specifying the number of \"great\"'s in the title of a relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$ (with some calculational forethought). The tree diagram can be more generic than a family tree though; thus cousinhood is just a way to put it into context/application and is not really essential to the meaning except through analogy. Notice the ordering of all terms; if the graph is directed, the arguments of the distance matters. The graph should probably be a tree locally if it is to be a well-defined relationship. $x_3$ is unchanged but $x_4$ is negated (multiplied by $-1$) by/under exchange of $x_1$ and $x_2$. The ordered pair $(x_3, x_4)$ is named \"consanguistance between $x_1$ and $x_2$ (in that order)\" by Curtis Franks. For a normal family tree and fixed $x_1$ therein, consanguistance produces countably many equivalence classes of nodes. It does not recognize the difference between half or full relatives, marriages/parentings are either unsupported (when $x_3 > 0$) or are reduced to be equivalent (when $x_3 = 0$ and $x_4 \\neq 0$), and gender/sex are ignored/reduced to equivalence. The set of nodes $x_2$ with $x_3 = 0$ is called $x_1$'s (the subject's) genealogical line (id est: if $x_3 = 0$, then $x_1$ re'au'e ja se dzena $x_2$ according to the edge relation on the graph or $x_1 = x_2$); the set of nodes with $x_3 > 0$ are sibling/branch/side lines, which could be labelled and ordered, but doing so would be somewhat difficult with this word. This word focuses on the relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$, not the relationship between each of them and A; for that, see \".{anseingu}\". The underlying tree graph is, modulo an equivalence relation involving tseingu, a 'quipyew' tree graph (see \"{grafnkipliiu}\"). This concept is fairly unnatural and convoluted, so it is probably {malgli} except for the purpose of translations; in a natural, culturally-neutral Lojbanic context, \".anseingu\" is preferred.","t":"fu'ivla","g":["consanguinity values","consanguistance","cousin degree","cousin order","cousin removal","degree of removal","kinship number"]},"tsekane":{"d":"$x_1$ (linear manifold, vector, etc.) is/lies secant to $x_2$ (object, surface, curve, manifold, etc.) passing through or toward points/loci $x_3$ (set of intersected points), by standard/definition/in system $x_4$.","n":"No necessary implication of co-directionality.

If a language lacks a minimal pair which distinguishes paired phonés, then any strings which nominally differ in only such pairs will belong to $x_2$ of this word in that language; in other words allophonic but not phonemic differences produce such similarities. But even with minimal pairs, some words may not be distinguishable. This word refers to indistinguishability in the form of a word as well as its meaning/usage; so, homophones are not necessarily similar in this sense, nor are synonyms. The combination of both qualities does produce such similarities in spoken English (not necessarily written English, since the orthography is not phonemic). In English, phonation duration and, in some cases, certain phonation qualities (such as tonation, voicing, nasalation, place of articulation, aspiration, etc. (again: only in some cases)) do not distinguish words. Dialectal differences usually produce such similarities too (a U.S. English speaker and a UK English speaker will say the word \"car\" differently but will agree about everything concerning it, including its rhyming qualities in their dialects, its meaning, and its spelling). In Lojban, phonation duration (such as \".{yyy} \" versus merely \".{y} \"; but notice that some transcriptions are interpreted as producing multiphthongs/glides/syllabification, so \".{iii} \" is distinct from mere \".{i} \") and minor differences in place of articulation (trilled \"r\" versus English \"r\", for example) and sometimes voicing (for nasals, rhotics, laterals, and presently xy) do not produce word distinctions; so, they will generate such similarities in Lojban.

In different bases, this value may change; for example, in hexadecimal, it might be exactly four ($4$); however, this is an outstanding as-of-yet unsolidified area in the Lojban grammar/semantics (do \"{ki'o}\" and Metric prefixes change according to the base?). This number is nice, as it is close to both 3 and and the circle constant pi ($\\pi$) in decimal usage; these three values arise fairly frequently and a great trick in decimal Fermi estimation is to use their approximate identity in order to simplify expressions. Now, when the quantity is dimensionful (has units), if the mantissa approximates this value, then one can instead express the mantissa as approximately 1 and the unit as being augmented by this prefix. This word is also good for short-hand/quick expressions. This word has no English equivalent and is not part of the official set of SI prefixes, but it does generalize them. \"{xaudbo}\" = \"{kamre} {li} {dau} {te'a} {fi'u} {re}\" in decimal (if it generalizes for other bases, change \"dau\" into the base; in other words, \"dau\" generally becomes \"pano\" in such case, where the base is given by context). While this suggestion is not perfectly compatible with SI (which allows only one prefix at a time), the negative-power version of this (\"kamre li dau te'a {ni'u} fi'u re\", where \"dau\" has the aforementioned caveats; $1*10^{-(1/2)}$) can just be expressed as a lujvo/rafsi/tanru containing both \"{decti}\" and this word (as veljvo/selrafsi/{seljavytertau}), because $A^{(-1/2)} = \\sqrt{(1/A)} = A^{(+1/2)} / A$, and $A$ (ten in at least decimal) is the base.

This color is a subset/element (depending on interpretation/usage) of the colors associated with light in the radio and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Speaker determines how close \"approximately twenty-one centimeters\" is to exactly twenty-one centimeters. Technically can only be used for the coloration of light that would arise from the hyperfine spin-flip transition of a hydrogen atom (without any neutrons) in which the proton-electron quantum spin configuration abruptly changes from parallel to antiparallel in the 1s groundstate.  But other isotopes and/or hydrogenic (id est: single-electron) atoms can be referenced by semantic broadening; note that in any case, this word always refers to the color of the light emitted from such an object. This is a color, not a description of the process, conditions under which the light of this color is emitted, etc., nor is it the light itself nor wavelength of the light.  However, this term probably will come up in all such descriptions.  For example, \"hyperfine spin-flip transition\" might be rendered {xipfne binxo}. Technically, any object that emits photons with wavelengths of approximately twenty-one centimeters will be of the color xipfne, regardless of why such emission is occurring (id est: it need not be due to hydrogen hyperfine, proton/electron spin-flip transitions).  Usage in such a case is perfectly acceptable.  However, in practice, such occasions/contexts will be rare (essentially completely absent except in theory) and the only common usage will be in the context of hydrogen hyperfine proton/electron spin-flip transitions (as in astronomy, chemistry, or quantum mechanics). This is an electromagnetic (id est: light, photon) color.

Letteral strings which act as numerical/mathematical variables are within the scope of potential reference, but not those which do not (unless they are somehow used in a mathematical expression which is being referenced as a whole); quotations and abstractions behave as the latter case for letteral strings wrt this word. Within a mekso expression, \"{du}\" and other predicates are taken as terminating a numerical expression; this word (unless subscripted; see infra) references completed numerical/mathematical expressions, and thus will not refer to the one in which it itself appears, which should help to avoid self-reference, predication issues, non-terminating loops, nondefinition issues, etc. Thus, it might be useful for recursive definitions. Subscript this word with an integer $n$ in order to refer count $n$ potential referents back (positive $n$ is back-counting, $n = 0$ refers to the current numerical/mathematical expression in which this subscripted word is embedded (once completed and fully evaluated, if such terminates), and negative $n$ is forward-counting). Can be used for quantifying sumti; \"one hundred men and horses\" probably means \"one hundred men and one hundred horses\", and the latter \"one hundred\" can be replaced by this word, because numerical/mathematical expressions which function as quantifiers are nonetheless numerical/mathematical expressions (and tend to be completed). Even in a recursive or self-referential context, once the referenced/pointed-to expression is evaluated, the value which it takes in its most-recent usage is the one which should be substituted in place of this word; use \"{ra'o}\" in order to update it if such is desired (and the value depends to some extent on the new context or other developments).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"PA","g":["most-recent mathematical expression","most-recent numerical expression"]},"xobgobeli":{"d":"$x_1$ is a hobgoblin of type/mythology $x_2$","n":"See {crida}, {ridgobeli}","t":"fu'ivla","g":["hobgoblin"]},"xod":{"d":"Xod.","n":"A name used by Charles Hope.","t":"cmevla","g":["Xod"]},"xodnocono":{"d":"$x_1$ reflects/pertains to Haudenosaunee/Six Nations/Iroquois culture/people in aspect $x_2$.","t":"fu'ivla","g":["Haudenosaunee","Iroquois","Six Nations"]},"xo'e":{"d":"elliptical/unspecified number.","n":"See also {no'o}, {tu'o}, {xo}, {zo'e}, {co'e}, and {do'e}.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"PA4","g":["elliptical digit","some"]},"xo'ei":{"d":"unary mekso operator: produces a string of n consecutive \"xo'e\"'s, treated as digits (concatenated into a single string of digits)","n":"n can be any nonnegative integer, (countable) infinity, or vague (in which case it could mean a nonnegative integer or (countable) infinity).

Since {pi} belongs to PA, technically at least zero {xo'e}'s can actually be meant to be radix point(s); at most, the total allowable number of radix points in a digit string, less the number of explicitly mentioned {pi}'s that occur therein (within the macrodigit), is the number of {pi}'s that can be referenced elliptically by this means. {ma'u} and {ni'u} are possible references for microdigits where allowed by the base.

If this word is followed by a number of/evaluated to a value 0 or 1 (preceded immediately by \"li\"), this value is taken to be an explicit reset of the mode to the value indicated (the value in question is called a seed value). Iff the seed value is 1, the mode is set thereinafter to multiplicative style; iff the seed value is 0, the mode is set thereinafter to additive style. (That is: the seed values represent the identity elements under the operation which the mode emulates.).  No other value, numerical or otherwise (including other sumti or even Boolean values, which actually mean \"truth\" and \"false\", rather than \"1\" and \"0\" respectively, despite common representations), may act as a seed value of this word.  Thus, only in the context of this word being followed by a \"li\"-introduced mekso expression X which evaluates to the numbers 0 or 1 wherein X is not intended to be taken as a seed value of this word must this word be followed by {ku} prior to X; in this case there is no explicit seed value. If this word has no explicit seed value, then this word causes the mode of interpretation of double-negatives to switch between multiplicative style and additive style; an utterance of this word switches the mode to whichever of these two options was not being used immediately previously.  Thus, it is its own terminator/negator.  Lojban default (without context) is in multiplicative mode: \"mi na na nelci\" is nearly equivalent to \"mi nelci\"; double-negatives cancel leaving a positive sense (even if it is not entirely/definitively affirmative). So, one utterance of this word (under standard conventions) in a given discourse will change double-negatives to become additive. This mode is similar to (some) Spanish negation or AAVE negation; multiple negatives compound/add together, intensifying the negativity (subjective truth-value) of an utterance.  In additive mode, \"[zau'e'u] mi na na nelci\" is equivalent to \"mi ba'e na nelci\" or something of the like; \"[zau'e'u] mi na na na na nelci\" would be simply further emphasized (roughly twice as emphatic as the previous example's negation).

Given the other sumti in the predicate (filling the corresponding terbri), the underlying relation (selbri) is claimed to be invalid in this circumstance. Examples: \"non-integrable\", \"non-measurable\" (confer: \".{umre}\"), \"non-summable\" (say, of strings), \"the limit does not exist\". This avoids the necessity of creating a pair of words for every such mathematical concept (one for when the operation may be applied to the inputs so as to yield a well-defined value which may be specified and one for when such is not the case). Other uses may develop or be found. This word does not 'delete' the terbri (unlike \"{zi'o}\"); it simply says that the selbri is not really applicable. Whether or not the meaning of this word is within the generic semantic range of \"{zo'e}\" is debatable and not yet well-established. The conventions employed matter. The case of the product of zero and infinity usually must be handled by a separate definition (especially when dealing only with strictly real numbers); it is quite common to explicitly handle this case by defining the product as zero, but prior to such definition, \"lo pilji be li no bei li ci'i\" is meaningless and undefined (the symbols can be written but do not actually mean anything) - so, $pilji_1$ should be filled with this word in such a circumstance. As another example, unless the difference of infinity with infinity is defined (and following the convention that unconnected points have a graph distance of positive countable infinity), which is unnatural, the relationship represented by \"{tseingu}\" is undefined in its fourth terbri (so, it can be filled with this word) when its first and second sumti belong to mutually different trees (leaving their most recent mutually common ancestor undefined). Notice that the other terbri are well-defined in this circumstance - in particular, $tseingu_3$ is positive countable infinity; also notice that this word has a slightly less mathematical flavor (especially insofar as the first terbri is not result of applying a mathematical operation to the following terbri) than many other ready examples. Yet another example: In a zero-dimensional universe, $klama_4$ and possibly $klama_5$, as well as even more arguably $klama_2$, are undefined (and can be filled with this word), leaving the notion of 'going' empty and meaningless. In a $(-1)$-dimensional universe (an empty set), every terbri of \"{klama}\" (and probably every other word) is undefined and can be filled with this terbri.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"KOhA","g":["non-existent it","undefining it"]},"zi'e":{"d":"joins relative clauses which apply to the same sumti.","t":"cmavo","s":"ZIhE","g":["relative clause joiner"]},"zi'e'a":{"d":"converts a following bu-letteral into a sumti representing the musical natural note with that name.","n":"The next bu-letteral is absorbed and a natural accidental is given to it; e.g. \"zi'e'a gy\" means \"the note G-natural\".

In order to be well-defined, all elements of $x_2$ united with the singleton of $x_1$ must be ordered according to the ordering endowing $x_4$; if $x_4$ lacks a good order, then $x_1$ is undefined. $x_4$ must be an ordered structure, not simply a set. Warning: If $x_3$ is explicitly filled, that is the only direction which is to be assumed.  If it is not explicitly filled, only one (or, arguably, possibly zero) direction(s) is(/are) to be assumed; in this context, it is to be inferred that the set $x_2$ is (possibly) bounded on at least one side/in at least one direction.  Connecting arguments by 'AND' in $x_3$ implies that $x_2$ is the set formed by the singleton of $x_3$; it is NOT the equivalent to the English term \"bound(ed)\" without qualifiers/adjectives (for that meaning, use modulus/absolute value/norm on the input of $x_1$). The bound is not strict (proposal: use {praperi} for this sense), but must be true of all elements of $x_2$ in that direction ($x_3$); it is not necessarily the extremal/best finite bound on $x_2$. $x_1$ is typically finite; submitting any infinity for it is arguably bad form but would imply that no element of $x_2$ is infinite on the side determined by $x_3$ (where \"infinite\" has meaning determined also by $x_4$; again, for \"finite\", use modulus/absolute value/norm) - no other information (about its being bounded or unbounded) can be discerned (unless the sumti in $x_3$ and/or $x_4$ are incompatible). For explicit statement of unboundedness (in a more general sense, possibly including ill-definition of what \"boundedness\" even means in this context) in the direction determined by $x_3$, use {zi'au} as the sumti of $x_1$ (confer earlier note about compatibility of definition and ordering of $x_4$ with $x_2$). $x_4$ can be more exotic than simply the field of real numbers.","t":"fu'ivla","g":["bounded set","lower bound","set of only finite elements","unbounded set","upper bound"]},"zmicu'a":{"d":"$x_1$ selects $x_2$ from $x_3$ (set) by default.","t":"lujvo","g":["default choice"]},"zmiku":{"d":"$x_{1}$ is automatic in function $x_{2}$ under conditions $x_{3}$.","n":"See also {macnu}.","t":"gismu","g":["automatic"],"r":["zmi","zmik"]},"zmimakfa":{"d":"$x_1$ is automagic to $x_2$, performed by technology $x_3$.","n":"See also {skami}, {certu}, {bebna}.","t":"lujvo","g":["automagic"]},"zminirci'e":{"d":"$c_1$ x1 (mass) is a/the autonomic nervous system interrelated by structure $c_2$ among neurons/components $n_1$=$c_3$ (set) of body $n_2$, displaying $c_4$ (ka).","t":"lujvo","g":["autonomic nervous system"]},"zmiselcu'a":{"d":"$x_1$ is the default choice of chooser $x_2$ from the set $x_3$","n":"See {cuxna}, {zmiku}","t":"lujvo","g":["default choice"]},"zmrenda":{"d":"$x_1$ is a snack, any time of the day or night, of ingredients/contents $x_2$, of type/variety $x_3$","n":"Spanish \"merienda\"; Tagalog \"meryenda\"","t":"fu'ivla"},"zmufoi":{"d":"$x_1$ is a corn field/maize field","t":"lujvo","g":["corn field","maize field"]},"zmujalna":{"d":"$j_1$ is a quantity of/contains/is made of corn/maize starch/cornflour/maizena from maize/corn $z_1$.","t":"lujvo","g":["corn starch","maizena","maize starch"]},"zo":{"d":"quote next word only; quotes a single Lojban word (not a cmavo compound or tanru).","t":"cmavo","s":"ZO","g":["1-word quote"]},"zo'a":{"d":"location tense relation/direction; tangential to/passing by ...","t":"cmavo","s":"FAhA4","g":["tangential to"],"r":["zon","zo'a"]},"zo'ai":{"d":"quotes a selbri.","n":"Roughly equivalent to {lu} *selbri* {li'u}, but shorter and way more convenient to use.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"LE"},"zo'anjo":{"d":"$x_1$ (linear manifold, vector, etc.) is/lies tangent to $x_2$ (object, surface, curve, manifold, etc.) at point/locus $x_3$, by standard/definition/in system $x_4$.","n":"No necessary implication of co-directionality.

This differs from \"{tezu'e}\" in that this word opens a metacommentary on why the author/speaker/utterer is deciding to utter the tagged construct, and is not expressing the goals of the actors within the main/rest of the bridi; for example \"{mi} {klama} te zu'e {lo} {nu} {zanfri}\" roughly means \"I went for the fun of it\" or \"I went in order to have fun there (or via the act of the journey itself)\", whereas \"{mi} {klama} zu'ei {zanfri}\" means something like \"I express the following utterance to you for the sake of (someone's) enjoyment: I went.\" (maybe this is some sort of joke).
