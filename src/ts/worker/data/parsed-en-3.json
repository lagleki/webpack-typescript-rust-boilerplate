For example, in \"lu mu'o'u lu coi li'u li'u mu'o'u\", the first instance of this word attaches to the second \"{lu}\" (because it is inside the quotation produced by the first \"lu\") and the second instance of this word attaches to the second instance of \"{li'u}\"; it cannot appear adjacent to \"{coi}\" in this example and yet function in application to the expressed quotation markers because it would then be inside all of the available quotations (nested, in this case), although such is allowed as a pure string (because being able to quote an expression such as \"He did say \"mu'o'u\"\" is utile). In a quotation (such as a \"lu\"-\"li'u\" quotation) with two markers (initiation and termination), even if one of them is implicit: if this word appears before the quote (at its initiation), then it means that there is no relevant and material information preceding the original version of the presented quote which would drastically alter its interpretation (for example: if the original is \"not big\", then \"big\" is technically a quote/substring thereof but there is information prior to this substring which materially alters the interpretation, namely \"not\"; likewise, cutting out the subject of a sentence which is being quoted and then using the quote in a context in which the subject is implied to be someone or something other than the original constitutes a material change in meaning due to incompleteness and this word would specify against that); if the word appears after the quote (at its termination), then it means that there is no relevant and material information following the original version of the presented quote which would drastically alter its interpretation (for example: if the original is \"he chose the men and the women\" but the presented quote/substring is \"he chose the men\" (in a context such that sexism is being accused), then there is information following the presented quote/substring which alters the interpretation, namely \"and the women\"); note that the interpretation-altering information need not immediately precede or follow the presented quote. For singly-marked quotes (such as by \"{zo}\") it means that the presented quote/string/expression is complete on both ends (including being the complete word / all relevant rafsi in a lujvo).

The number of polytope 'tiles' used can be specified in the third of fifth terbri as desired; the polytopes used need not all be the same, nor regular, so long as the arrangement is meaningful and possible. One of the main differences between rectangular polyplets and polyominoes is that polyominoes cannot have their polytope tiles touching only at their vertices whereas polyplets can (thus, polyominoes are a subset of the rectangular polyplets); this difference can be specified in the final terbri. A tiling of a space may be considered to be an infinite polyform, but that is rather pathological and we can reasonably assume that polyforms referenced by this word will be finite. The polyform is considered to be a unified whole entity. The ambient space is usually going to be the Euclidean space of the same dimension as the polytopes (and the former dimension cannot be exceeded by the latter except in the marginal case of lower-dimensional (id est: hyperplanar) arrangements, in which case parallel cross-sections are really being considered); this space determines the rigid-motion/symmetry isomorphisms of various polyforms (Z and S tetraminoes are non-isomorphic under rigid-motion in the Euclidean plane but are so isomorphic in Euclidean 3-space). The ambient space also determines the expression of (and indeed the 'allowed') polytopes: spherical geometry allows for digons to be arranged so as to form a polyform, but Euclidean 2-space prohibits such objects from the set of possible polygons. The default polytope will probably be a 2-dimensional square; thus the default ambient space will likely be Euclidean 2-space.

This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. \"Multiplicative negation\" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). \"I did not see nothing\" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. \"I like cheese\" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to \"I do not dislike cheese\", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another (\"I am indeed very much so going!\" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, \"I am going\"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement (\"I am indeed - not - going\" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to \"I may be going\"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer (\"I am indeed not going\" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"NEIhAI","g":["double-negative mode toggle"]},{"w":"nei'au","d":"unary mekso operator: $(-1)^x$","n":"Macro for exponentiating -1 by the input, which is an extremely common term.

Inside the module formed by the \"sei'au\" brackets, at most three sumti (where this counting contracts connected sumti into one) can be specified. The first one is a {mau'au}-{zai'ai} quoted function (which is taken to be the operand of this word); it must be preceded (not necessarily immediately) by {li}; let f be this function. The second and third sumti each are a nonnegative integer (preceded by {li}); call them $n$ and $m$ respectively; $n$ defaults to 1 and $m$ defaults to the next (thus-far unfilled) terbri number for/of the current selbri unless these specifications are overridden by zmico; if the relevant selbri has no terbri following this word, then this default value of $m$ causes this word to have no effect. The $m$th terbri of the selbri to which this construct applies will be passed through f before being filled by any sumti (including {zo'e}, explicit or implicit; terbri numbers start counting at 1 and increase by 1 with each new occurrence) for the next $n$ occurrences of the aforementioned selbri in the discourse (with $n$ = 1 counting the current occurrence; aside: a non-default value of $m$ can thus affect the interpretation of an already-filled terbri of the currently open selbri in an afterthought manner); this counting is only done forward in the discourse/time, including the current selbri, never back through it. Thus, $n$ = 0 effectively neutralizes this word, $n$ being infinite causes the effect to be permanent. f being {zi'a'o} returns the terbri in question to its default value/understanding (according to zmico). It is important to realize that this word does not affect the $m$th terbri of all selbri, just of the one currently open when this word is utterred (no matter where it is positioned/nested in future costructs). If this word is in conflict with another usage of this word over the same terbri, follow the specification applied by the most recent still active occurrence of this construct; this construct is considered to be active for this purpose until its-$n$ occurrences of the appropriate terbri are uttered; thus if the earlier-$n$ is greater than the later-$n$, the later effect takes precedent until it is disactivated, after which point the earlier effect resumes. Define $n$ and  $m$ (and f) outside of the module created by brackets of this word if you wish to reuse them; for the sake of future referencing the value specified within the module, $n$ gets reduced/decremented by 1 at each occurrence of the appropriate terbri until it reaches the value 0 (at which value it remains forever after); if $n$ is a series of connected numbers, this decrementation is applied to each connectand in turn. Use {pi'u} (possibly subscripted) in order to simplify utterances. Especially helpful if f is non-injective. The affected terbri must be referenced by {ce'u} as an operand of f wheresoever it is desired; this reference must be explicit.  Let 'broda' be the currentry open selbri; then this word replaces $broda_m$ with f($broda_m$) in the definition of 'broda' for the next $n$ occurrences of the terbri. For example, if f were {cu'a}, then any sumti which fills $broda_m$ will be understood to be doing so in absolute value.

Subscript a set of numbers that represent the order of terbri in question; the subscripted set can be a set of ordered or unordered tuples, specifying exactly which terbri may be exchanged. 'la .ralf. se'u'o xi li re ce li ci pi'u li re cebo li ci klama by boi cy' = 'Did Ralph come to B from C or to C from B?' (notably, 'Did B come to Ralph from C?' is not a possible option for answering the question). An answer is a SE string that is allowed by the selbri and by the subscripts; continuing the example, if the response is 'Ralph went to C from B', one would respond with '.i {setese}'.  Any SE word works for the general question possibility (which is the unrestricted/non-subscripted case). Essentially 'se'u'o xi sy' is equivalent to 'se xi li xo poi ke'a cmima sy' (where '{te}' is basically understood as ' se xi li jo'i pa boi ci te'u ', etc.), but the answer can be a complicated ordered sequence/string of SE words; this word complements specifically {fi'a} in the typical/same way that SE complements FA. Typically, leaving the subscripted set vague or not completely free of every possible semantic or syntactic pathology is perfectly fine; syntax and practicality will typically restrict it enough for reasonable responses to be made.

Thereafter, every subsequent explicit usage of this word alters the toggle status for story time interpretation between explicit application ('on') and explicit not-application ('off'), and nothing else, so that the toggle status immediately after such a usage differs from the toggle status immediately prior to such usage; consequently, within a given text/narrative/conversation/utterance, all odd-numbered explicit usages of this word cause story time interpretation to apply (the resultant toggle status is explicitly 'on') and all even-numbered explicit usages of this word cause story time interpretation to no longer apply (the resultant toggle status is explicitly 'off').

Theoretically, a jump to another location or perspective but at the same (or imemdiately-following) instant could also be marked in this way.

Postal codes or ZIP codes should be used with caution in this word - they must be inserted in the correct spot; for example, (in the U.S.) a standard ZIP code identifies (approximately) the administering post office or municipal region and, therefore, must come after a street name but usually before the city name; ZIP+4 usually identifies a subdivision of the city or service area for the local post office, so it would come after the street name but before the city name and the standard ZIP code; ZIP+4+2 is usually enough to identify a building, so it would precede the street name (but may follow the apartment number in some cases); going the other way: the first few digits identify the region of the country or type of high-level administrative subunit of the U.S. and would come somewhere after the state name or similar. Containment is not assumed to be proper, so consecutive sumti may be equivalent (for example ZIP+4+2 can be equivalent to the house/building identifier and street address, but may be strictly contain the apartment identifier). Delete $x_1$ in order to talk of things like \"Chesterfield, New Hampshire\" (tcaudu$_2$ = Chesterfield, tcaudu$_3$ = New Hampshire); in this case, since the terbri structure of this word (after tcaudu$_1$) is constant/symmetric wrt shift in sumti slot (indexing), it may be cleanest and most elegant to begin the bridi with the selbri. Any number of consecutive unfilled sumti slots (after tcaudu$_1$) is technically equivalent but may be used informally in order to show that the utterer has a well-defined or standard sequence of nested classes which subdivide the subsequent sumti and which contain the previous ones. Deleting any finite number of sumti slots after the first has no nontrivial effect. This word might be generalizable to other nested structures or graphs such as information in a file (example: cell coordinates, tab name, Excel file name, directory to which the file directly belongs, next superdirectory thereof, ..., stem directory) or members in a family tree (example: full name of person, branch of family, larger family name, ..., all of humanity, ..., all of Earth life).
